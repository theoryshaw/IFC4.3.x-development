ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committee. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO. also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see wwwiso.orgeirectives).

This edition cancels and replaces ISO 16739:2018 which had been technically revised and restructured.

The main changes are:

> NOTE Preliminary

- The addition of semantic constructs for infrastructure and civil engineering definitions
- The inclusion of geometric transition curves for the purpose of infrastructure alignment curve definitions
- A new type of placement to position elements along such alignment curves and semantic constructs to document such positioning
- A refinement of the constructs for georeferencing

A complete list of all changes is provided in Annex F 'Change logs".

A list of all parts in the ISO 16739 series can be found on the ISO websile.
